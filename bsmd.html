            <h2>BS/MD Admissions Counselling</h2>
            <p>In recent years, BS/MD programs, where a student is simultaneously accepted to undergrad and medical school, have seen an immense increase in popularity and competitiveness. The reason is simple: as acceptance rates drop into the low single digits (&#60 5-7%) for medical school and undergrad institutions continue to increase the difficulty of their pre-med track, more and more students want to have a guarantee of becoming a doctor. For students who know that they want to pursue a career in medicine, the best option may be to pursue studies at a BS/MD program, which offers academic flexibility, ability to study abroad, accelerated track, and most important of all, stress-free educational experience with the knowledge that he/she will become a doctor no matter what.</p>
            <p>The desire to attend a B.S./M.D. program must manifest itself in multiple ways throughout the student’s application; the earlier, the better for getting started on prep work for applying to these programs. The students who pursue a B.S./M.D. path normally have years of medical experience, significant volunteering, prominent/well-recognized extracurriculars at which they excel, research experience. In addition, when applying, students must be able to convey their experiences and journey as a cohesive story in the form of essays that resonate with the admission officers, both of the undergrad and of the medical school. In addition, the interview for these programs is critical. Although interviews to general undergraduate schools may often be informational and may not play a significant role in college admissions decisions, it is the complete opposite for B.S./M.D. programs. For BS/MD programs, the medical school interview can make or break an application.</p>
