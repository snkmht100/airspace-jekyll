            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Top College Admissions is a revolutionary college admissions and test prep service created by students at top colleges to foster the growth of their high school counterparts. We’re a team of students who have been admitted to and attend <b>Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Rice, Northwestern, Brown, Georgia Tech (President's Scholarship), and University of Georgia (Foundation Fellowship)</b> and are united by a common goal: how to pass on our experience and lessons from our own applications to make the complex world of college admissions a bit simpler for students and their parents. </p>
          </div>
          <p>Our tutors and curriculum developers are all intimately familiar with the college admissions process and standardized testing– we all have been through the applications process in the last five years, and we know what it takes to succeed in an environment where admission rates continue to decrease every year. The Top College Approach guarantees that you will be working with someone that knows what they are doing: <b>all of our tutors scored a 2300+ or higher on the SAT, attend one of the top universities in the country, and most importantly, have experience mentoring students to achieve their academic goals</b>.  </p>

          <h4>SAT/ACT</h4>
          <!-- <h5>Average Increase of 300 Points</h5> -->
          <p>Students aren’t standardized, so why should their preparation be? Our unique approach is based on individually tailored curriculum that focuses on pinpointing weak areas using data analytics. Through massive question banks, practice exams, and concept instruction using official CollegeBoard and ACT material, we are able to generate worksheets that adapt problems for each student and result in an <b>average SAT score increase of 290 points</b>. Data-driven preparation coupled with our one-on-one tutoring sessions ensures that Top College students are most ready to perform to the best of their ability on test day.</p>

          <h4>College Admissions</h4>
          <!-- <h5>Counseling for the Application Process</h5> -->
          <p>Our counselors have been accepted to some of the top institutions - <b>Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, UPenn, Duke, Rice</b>, and many more super selective academic schools in recent years. We are incredibly familiar with the modern day application process – through lessons learned from our own high school preparation, application crafting, and essay writing, we are ready to help you navigate the complex process of applying to college. Whether you are just entering high school as a ninth grader or a senior ready to apply to college, we are ready to help you best present your unique story to your dream school! </p>

          <h4>BS/MD</h4>
          <!-- <h5>Guaranteed Medical School Admission</h5> -->
          <p>Students who want to pursue a career in medicine may find the best option is a BS/MD program, where they are able to pursue their interests while having the assurance of being accepted to medical school and becoming a doctor. Admit rates to B.S./M.D. programs are often lower than getting into an Ivy League school. Our counselors have been accepted to some of the top BS/MD programs – <b>Northwestern HPME, Brown PLME, Rice/Baylor</b> – and are incredibly familiar with the BS/MD admission pathway including extracurricular activities, volunteering, research, essays, and interview prep. </p>

          <h4>AP Tests/Subject Tutoring</h4>
          <!-- <h5>99th Percentile Tutors for Subjects You Need</h5> -->
          <p>As college admissions continue to get more and more competitive, students seek more ways to differentiate themselves from the competition. One way to get noticed by admission officers is through excellent performance on Advanced Placement (AP) tests and SAT Subject tests, which indicate college-level mastery of a particular subject. <b>Our tutors have all scored 5s on AP exams and 750+ on SAT Subject tests</b>, and they are extremely qualified to teach you the content material for these exams. At Top College Admissions, we can set you apart from the competition, even before you set foot on a college campus! </p>

      <h2>WE BELIEVE IN GREAT IDEAS AND GREAT PEOPLE</h2>
      <p>Whether you're in Atlanta or Anchorage, we can work together from the comfort of your own home - according to your schedule - be it SAT/ACT prep, college admissions counselling, academic tutoring, or applications.</p>
      <p>Our diverse team of counselors and tutors at Top College Admissions can offer fresh insight into the application process, grounded in our own successful experiences with college admissions. All of our counsellors have recently and successfully applied to elite colleges and scored in the 99th percentile nationwide.</p>
      <p>Applying to college today is a completely different process than it was years ago. As a result, other counselors may be out of touch with the current process, having attended college and having taken the SAT several decades ago. We can offer a perspective which others cannot.</p>
