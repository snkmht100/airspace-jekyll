            <h2>SAT/ACT</h2>
            <p>We know that modern day tutoring services are extremely out-of-touch. Traditional tutoring companies are dependent on the same classroom-based instruction that has been used for the last hundred years. Technology has eliminated the need for a standardized curriculum and traditional teaching, so why hasn't the tutoring environment adapted?</p>
            <p>The Top College Approach brings together data-driven analytics and individualized one-on-one sessions to help our students see an increase of 300-600 points on the new SAT and similar increases on the ACT. For example, when we see a student miss a question on advanced algebra, we don’t just say the student is having a problem with advanced algebra, but rather a problem with quadratics, and more specifically, factoring quadratics. Using all of this data, we are able to compile a set of weak areas for the student, and use an algorithm to generate worksheets and practice problems to eliminate weaknesses in specific areas. At the same time, the curriculum is tailored to your strengths and your individual learning style. One-on-one tutoring with a tutor who has scored 2300+ and in the 99th percentile ensures that you are able to receive prompt help from someone who has been in your shoes.</p>
            <p>As always, the Top College Approach means that you will be working with the best of the best. All of our tutors scored a 2300+ or higher on the SAT and attend one of the top universities in the country. We also understand high school students often times have busy schedules. We’ll work to create a plan that works around your schedule and helps you succeed.</p>
